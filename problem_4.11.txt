Write a program named Fibonacci that prints the Fibonacci
sequence of numbers. The first two numbers in the sequence
are 1. Every other number in the sequence is the sum of two
previous numbers. Your program should prompt the user to
enter a limit; the program will stop when the current number
in the sequence is greater than or equal to this limit. Here's
what the user will see when the program is executed:

This program prints the Fibonacci sequence

Enter a limit on the largest number to be displayed: 50

1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

Hint: Use three int variables to store the current number in
the sequence, the previous number in the sequence, and the
next number in the sequence.
